# Fake-credit-card-detection-using-Machine-Learning

Fake-credit-card-detection using machine learning using supervised learning.
I used Random forest algorthim to build this system.

In this project we used the RFA to determine the difference between the real and fake credit card transcations.

I also attached my PPT and project review for clear understanding of this Project.
